# Olympic medals
*Accuracy Metric :

We use mean squared error (MSE) as the accuracy metric for evaluating the regression model's performance. MSE measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values.

#Model Training and Testing :

We split the dataset into training and testing sets and train a linear regression model using predictors such as previous medal counts, number of athletes, and events participated in. The model is then used to make predictions on the test set.

#Evaluation Results :

The mean absolute error (MAE) is calculated to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions. Additionally, we compare the error to the standard deviation of the target variable to assess the model's performance.

#Insights :

Analysis reveals insights into the prediction errors for specific countries and error ratios relative to the average number of medals won by each country.

#Conclusion :

In conclusion, the project demonstrates the potential of using historical data to predict Olympic medal counts. However, there are limitations and areas for future improvement, such as incorporating more features and refining the model architecture.
